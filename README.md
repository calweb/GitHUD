# GitHUD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhendley25/GitHUD.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhendley25/GitHUD)

## About

**GitHUD** is  an open-source project for viewing github repository and user statistics in a meaningful way.  

## Contributions

Like any open-source project, everyone is welcome to send PRs and open issues.  It is my hope that this will take on a life of its own.

Since github's api doesn't like client-side-only authentication, we'll be getting a tiny server going at some point.  

## Current status

Still very much under development.  

On the short-list:

* Oauth stuff
* Fullscreen repo view
